        <p>The twenty-first century is experiencing an explosion of data; enormous streams of data are created every minute. The companies we work for, the electronic devices we use (cell phones, tablets), the organizations we interact with (banks, online stores, healthcare services, police departments), transportation modes (cars, airlines, rail), and sensors in infrastructures (bridges, oil rigs) all generate large data streams that are difficult to deal with. In fact, the world’s information doubles approximately every two years. This massive amount of information is referred to as “big data”. Challenges include capturing and storing data, searching and analyzing up-to-the-minute data quickly, and making timely, informed decisions based on the data. With 80% of data being unstructured or semi-structured, very large data sets cannot be dealt with using traditional tools such as relational databases, desktop software, and traditional servers. And with data volumes increasing exponentially, there is a pressing need for new systems to handle data in unprecedented amounts of terabytes, petabytes, and exabytes; not just to store it, but to process the data, analyze the data, and to use the data for informed decision making in a timely manner.</p>
