        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="kanchor74"></a>Example: Planning for multiple data sources and enrichments</h2>
        <p>Many <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> deployments are very straight-forward, including one data source, a few dimension tables for enrichment processing, a data model, one or two data sinks, and multiple alerts. However, a common, more complex, scenario involves two or more data streams, one of which is used to enrich the other. This example outlines a plan for configuring <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> for this situation. By creating two systems, processing times are reduced and data model enrichments are separated for ease of use. </p>
        <p>In this case, <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> will be configured with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Two systems</li>
            <li value="2">System #1: One data source, one parser, an interim input model, one enrichment, and a dimension data sink for enriched records (you could substitute the JSON&#160;to JDBC data sink for this example)</li>
            <li value="3">System #2: A second data source, a different parser, the final input model, several enrichments, a Hive data sink for processed records, and alerts </li>
            <li value="4">System #2 will get enrichment data from the dimension data sink created in System #1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consider this example in which an IT department wants to implement a cybersecurity solution. They are concerned that potentially malicious behavior on the network may be tied to one or more employees. They need to determine who is in the building and at their desks when specific network events occur. The data sources they have include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The badge reader data stream, which reports the times that employees enter and exit a secure building by scanning their badges</li>
            <li value="2">The network data stream, which lists all network activity throughout the organization but which does not identify users</li>
            <li value="3">The employee database, which correlates employee IDs  and badge numbers </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The IT department wants to enrich the badge reader data with employee IDs  so they can determine who entered and left the building at specific times. They then want to correlate that data with the network log to determine which employees were in the building when suspicious activity occurred.  </p>
        <p>Here's how their <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> systems are set up:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../resources/images/configuration/dimension_data_sink_example.png" class="large_graphic" />
        </p>
        <p><strong>System #1</strong> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Data source = Badge Reader Data</li>
            <li value="2">Parser = Log File Parser</li>
            <li value="3">Enrichment = Dimension Table Enrichment to correlate Badge ID with Employee ID</li>
            <li value="4">Dimension table = Employee Database</li>
            <li value="5">Data sink = Dimension Data Sink  (in the relational tenant database) to store enriched badge-in information </li>
            <li value="6">Input model = Definition of the records in the dimension data sink, including <strong>tableName </strong>and <strong>tableKey </strong>fields to link to the Dimension Data Sink (<a href="step_1_define_an_input_model.htm" class="MCXref xref">See "Step 1: Define an Input Model "</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>System #2</strong> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Data source = Network Activity</li>
            <li value="2">Parser = DNS Parser</li>
            <li value="3">Enrichments = Enriched Badge Reader Data from the Dimension Data Sink in System #1 </li>
            <li value="4">Data sink = Hive for storage of processed records</li>
            <li value="5">Data sink = Alerting Data Sink</li>
            <li value="6">Alerts: To notify IT of suspicious network activity</li>
            <li value="7">Input model = Definition of the processed network activity records in the Hive data sink</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's how this configuration works. The Badge Reader Data Stream is transported into System #1 in <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> and parsed by the Log File Parser. When the records are processed, they are enriched with data from the Employee Database to correlate the Badge ID with the Employee ID. The enriched and processed records are stored in the Dimension Data Sink  (in a relational tenant database), to serve as an enrichment data source for System #2. The data model in the system includes special <strong>tableName </strong>and <strong>tableKey </strong>fields to link to the Dimension Data Sink (<a href="step_1_define_an_input_model.htm" class="MCXref xref">See "Step 1: Define an Input Model "</a> ).</p>
        <p>Next,  the Network Activity Data Stream is transported into System #2 in <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> and parsed by the DNS Parser. The records are processed and enriched with records from the Dimension Data Sink in System #1, to match up last badge-in activity with suspicious network events. Processed and enriched records are stored in Hive, but are also sent through the alerting engine in the Alerting Data Sink to determine if suspicious activity has occurred. When a problematic record is found, it is flagged for notification in an Alert message. </p>
