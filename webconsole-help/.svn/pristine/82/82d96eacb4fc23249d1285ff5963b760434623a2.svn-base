        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="kanchor45"></a>Defining System Components</h2>
        <p>Once you have created a data model in <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>, you will build the processing pipeline and system configuration by identifying and assembling all the components in the system architecture. In addition to the data models and transports, you must identify data sinks and user applications. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="kanchor46"></a>Choosing data sinks</h2>
        <p>A data sink is a queue, server, or database that can receive pipeline-processed JSON&#160;data to store or post-process for other uses. For example, one data sink can index data for queries, several data sinks store historical or processed data, and the alerting engine data sink filters data for alerts.&#160; </p>
        <p><span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> provides many data sink options. Each data sink has its strengths and weaknesses; <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> plays to the strengths of each one to optimize performance of your repositories. For example, Lucene is particularly good for implementing real time searching on the data. If you need a data sink that is not included in the core release, your developers can create a custom data sink for your site.Here are some guidelines for choosing data sinks for specific uses.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor47"></a>Alerting data sink</h3>
        <p>Most <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> systems will be configured to identify possible cybersecurity breaches, situational anomalies, or potential fraud.  This data sink filters processed records for alert triggers and sends out alert messages either as email messages or as messages in a JMS topic. The data sink does not store <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>&#160;processed records.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor48"></a>Cassandra data sink</h3>
        <p>This beta data sink stores data in an Apache Cassandra cluster. Cassandra  handles big data across many servers with no single point of failure. The Cassandra cluster is decentralized, with no master node so that each node can fulfill any request. It is very easy to add nodes to a Cassandra configuration.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor49"></a>Dimension data sink</h3>
        <p>This data sink stores data for dimensional enrichments in the  tenant database. It serves two purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To provide an alternative method of uploading enrichment data into a dimension table, instead of the <strong>Table Manager</strong>&gt;<b>Batch Tools</b>&gt;<b>Import </b>functionality to upload CSV data into a table</li>
            <li value="2">To store records which were enhanced by a dimension table enrichment and which themselves will be used to enrich another data source (used when you have two data sources, one of which will enhance the other data source)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor50"></a>Elasticsearch data sink</h3>
        <p>This beta data sink implements Elasticsearch, an indexing and full text search engine. Elasticsearch is auto-scaling, auto-connects to other <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> nodes for true distributed processing, and support multi-tenancy. Each node hosts multiple index shards, forming and managing clustered operations. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor51"></a>External HBase data sink</h3>
        <p>This data sink stores data in an existing Hadoop/HBase cluster that is external to and not managed by <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>. If your organization already has applications that use HBase, you can send <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> processed data to that cluster with this data sink.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor52"></a>External HDFS data sink</h3>
        <p>This data sink stores data in an existing Hadoop cluster that is not managed by <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> (compatible with and distributed via Cloudera CDH3uX releases). If your organization already uses Hadoop clusters, you can send <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>&#160;processed data to that cluster by configuring a communication connection with this data sink. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor53"></a>External Hive data sink</h3>
        <p>This data sink is similar to the Hive data sink, but stores data in an existing Hadoop/Hive cluster that is not managed by <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>. If your organization already uses Hive clusters, you can send <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>&#160;processed data to that cluster by configuring a communication connection with this data sink. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor54"></a>HBase data sink</h3>
        <p>The HBase data sink stores processed <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> data in an HBase database that is managed internally by <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>. HBase was originally created to handle petabytes of data and is commonly used as a key value store.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor55"></a>Hive data sink</h3>
        <p>This data sink stores processed data in the Hadoop/Hive environment and is managed internally by <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>. Hive was originally created to interface SQL databases with Hadoop, so shops that were relational-based could continue to work in an SQL-like environment while interfacing to Hadoop MapReduce technology. Use this data sink to create a Hive cluster that is managed by <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor56"></a>JSON to JDBC data sink</h3>
        <p>This data sink maps <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> JSON objects to a relational database table and writes them to a specified database via JDBC (typically, an external database for additional processing or analysis). </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor57"></a>Lucene indexing data sink</h3>
        <p>If you plan to have your data searchable with the Search or SearchAPI web applications, you <i>must </i>add a Lucene data sink to the system. The Lucene data sink uses a copy of the processed <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> data and builds an inverted index for real-time and near real-time search. The index is optimized for searching. A Lucene index should be configured to 1.5 times the anticipated index size, to accommodate building and merging.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor58"></a>MongoDB data sink</h3>
        <p>This data sink is a general all-purpose NoSQL data sink that stores <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> processed JSON data in a MongoDBÂ® database which is managed by <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span>. Note that MongoDB records have a maximum size of 16 MB. MongoDB  can be configured in <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> to scale automatically. Each instance sets up its own copy of MongoDB, no cluster is created. With stand-alone databases, each instance will contain different data; as content comes off the processing pipeline, portions of the data may be sent to different instances. MongoDB&#160;is fast, compact, and good to use with external dashboards, reporting packages, or summarized data. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor59"></a>Sleep data sink</h3>
        <p>This data sink is used strictly for test purposes. It continually reads a record and then sleeps for a specified amount of time. Use it to test for the progress of records through the <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> pipeline. The data sink does not store or process records. </p>
