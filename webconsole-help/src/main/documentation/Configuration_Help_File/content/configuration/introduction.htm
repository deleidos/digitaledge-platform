        <p><span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> is a highly configurable software platform providing real-time analytics of big data in motion for cyber-security. The system is flexible enough to be configured as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"> a simple system that is quick to configure and stand up </li>
            <li value="2">a large and complex system that requires several people to design the configuration </li>
            <li value="3">an iterative design that can be changed and saved in multiple versions; this is particularly useful during a trial or test phase</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For simple systems, configuration tasks can be completed by one individual in a short amount of time. Large systems may require a team of professionals who work together to plan, design, configure, and implement the system.&#160;Data Specialists would have the important tasks of defining the data model, specifying the data sources for inputs, mapping data sources to the input model, and defining the required enrichments. Data Analysts would define filtering rules for alerts and interpret those alerts for potential fraud.  <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> Administrators would set up the system components, pipeline, and data sinks; they would also manage and monitor the system daily. </p>
        <p>As a <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> Administrator, think of yourself and your team as the architects of one or more <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> software systems. Before you can build the system, you should take the time to carefully plan your system, to design the inputs and data model, and to configure the components that will serve as the foundation of the system. <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> provides plug-in architecture for all its major components such as transports, parsers, enrichment processors, and data sinks. You can build a new system from pre-existing components, customize those components for your own site-specific needs, or create components from scratch.&#160;Data modeling is key to a successful configuration.</p>
        <p>These instructions will guide you through planning, configuring, and building your <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> system. Before plunging in, be sure to read the <i>Overview Guide</i>; it describes the system architecture, concepts, and terminology. These instructions assume you are familiar with those concepts.</p>
