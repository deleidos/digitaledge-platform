<p><strong>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0 </strong></p>
<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE   TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR   DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS   AGREEMENT. <br /><br />1. DEFINITIONS <br />&quot;Contribution&quot; means: <br />a) in the case of the initial   Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this   Agreement, and <br />b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: <br />i) changes to the   Program, and <br />ii) additions to the Program; <br />where such changes and/or additions   to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular   Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to   the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's   behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are   separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under   their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.   <br /><br />&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. <br /><br />&quot;Licensed   Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily   infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the   Program. <br /><br />&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this   Agreement. <br /><br />&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this   Agreement, including all Contributors. <br /><br />2. GRANT OF RIGHTS <br /><br />a) Subject to the   terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a   non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare   derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and   sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative   works, in source code and object code form. <br />b) Subject to the terms of this   Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,   royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to   sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if   any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the   combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution   is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such   combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not   apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per   se is licensed hereunder. <br />c) Recipient understands that although each   Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe   the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each   Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other   entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a   condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each   Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is   required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's   responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. <br />d) Each   Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights   in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this   Agreement. <br /><br />3. REQUIREMENTS <br /><br />A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in   object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: <br /><br />a) it complies   with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and <br />b) its license agreement:   <br />i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and   conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and   non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and   fitness for a particular purpose; <br />ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all   Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,   incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; <br />iii) states that any   provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor   alone and not by any other party; and <br />iv) states that source code for the   Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain   it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software   exchange. <br /><br />When the Program is made available in source code form: <br /><br />a) it must be   made available under this Agreement; and <br />b) a copy of this Agreement must be   included with each copy of the Program. <br /><br />Contributors may not remove or alter any   copyright notices contained within the Program. <br /><br />Each Contributor must identify   itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that   reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the   Contribution. <br /><br />4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION <br /><br />Commercial distributors of software may   accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and   the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the   Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product   offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for   other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a   commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby   agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified   Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)   arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party   against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or   omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of   the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do   not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual   property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)   promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)   allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial   Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The   Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.   <br /><br />For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product   offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that   Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties   related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such   Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the   Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other   Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court   requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial   Contributor must pay those damages. <br /><br />5. NO WARRANTY <br /><br />EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH   IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,   WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,   MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the   Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this   Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,   compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or   equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. <br /><br />6. DISCLAIMER OF   LIABILITY <br /><br />EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR   ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST   PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,   STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY   OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS   GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br /><br />7.   GENERAL <br /><br />If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary   to make such provision valid and enforceable. <br /><br />If Recipient institutes patent   litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a   lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program   with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such   Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date   such litigation is filed. <br /><br />All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall   terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of   this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time   after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this   Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the   Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations   under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the   Program shall continue and survive. <br /><br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute   copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is   copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement   Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this   Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the   right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement   Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the   Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the   Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including   Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement   under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement   is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its   Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections   2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the   intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether   expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not   expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. <br /><br />This Agreement is governed   by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the   United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action   under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each   party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

  not   sold, to you by Oracle. Oracle reserves all rights not expressly granted.   (b)<br />
  You may make a single archival copy of Software, but otherwise may not   copy,<br />
  modify, or distribute Software. However if the Oracle documentation   accompanying<br />
  Software lists specific po rtions of Software, such as header   files, class<br />
  libraries, reference source code, and/or redistributable files,   that may be<br />
  handled differently, you may do so only as provided in the Oracle   documentation.<br />
  (c) You may not rent, lease, lend or e ncumber Software. (d)   Unless enforcement<br />

  license. (f) You may not publish or provide the results   of any benchmark or<br />
  comparison tests run on Software to any third party   without the pri or written<br />
  consent of Oracle. (g) Software is confidential   and copyrighted. (h) Unless<br />
  otherwise specified, if Software is delivered   with embedded or bundled software<br />
  that enables functionality of Software, you   may not use such software on a <br />stand-alone basis or use any portion of such   software to interoperate with any<br />
  program(s) other than Software. (i)   Software may contain programs that perform<br />
  automated collection of system   data and/or automated software updating services.<br />
  S ystem data collected   through such programs may be used by Oracle, its<br />
  subcontractors, and its   service delivery partners for the purpose of providing<br />
  you with remote system   services and/or improving Oracle's software and systems.<br />
  (j) Software i s not   designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,<br />
  construction, operation   or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Oracle and its<br />
  licensors disclaim   any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.<br />

  trade name of   Oracle or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.<br />
  <br />
  6. Java   Compatibility and Open Source.<br />
  <br />
  Software may contain Java technology. You   may not create additional c lasses to,<br />
  or modifications of, the Java   technology, except under compatibility<br />
  requirements available under a   separate agreement available at www.java.net.<br />
  <br />
  Oracle supports and   benefits from the global community of open source developers, <br />
  and thanks the   community for its important contributions and open<br />
  standards-based   technology, which Oracle has adopted into many of its products.<br />
  <br />
  Please   note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and open<br />
  source   lice nses from such communities and third parties that govern the use   of<br />
  those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter any rights   and<br />
  obligations you may have under such open source licenses, however,   the<br />
  disclaimer of warranty an d limitation of liability provisions in this   Agreement<br />
  will apply to all Software in this distribution.<br />
  <br />
  7. Term and   Termination.<br />
  <br />
  The license and service term are set forth in your   Entitlement(s). Your rights<br />
  under this Agreement will terminate immediately   without notice from Oracle if you<br />
  materially breach it or take any action in   derogation of Oracle's and/or its<br />
  licensors' rights to Software. Oracle may   terminate this Agreement should any<br />
  Software become, or in Orac le's   reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of<br />
  a claim of intellectual   property infringement or trade secret misappropriation.<br />
  Upon termination, you   will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm<br />
  compliance in writing to   Oracle . Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive<br />
  termination of the   Agreement.<br />
  <br />
  8. Limited Warranty.<br />
  <br />
  Oracle warrants to you that for a   period of 90 days from the date of purchase, as<br />
  evidenced by a copy of the   receipt, the media on wh ich Software is furnished (if<br />
  any) will be free of   defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.<br />
  Except for the   foregoing, Software is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;. Your exclusive remedy<br />
  and Oracle's   entire liability under this limited warranty w ill be at Oracle's option<br />
  to   replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states   do<br />
  not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not   apply<br />
  to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal righ ts. You may   have<br />
  others, which vary from state to state.<br />
  <br />
  9. Disclaimer of   Warranty.<br />
  <br />
  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED   CONDITIONS,<br />
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY   OF<br />
  MERC HANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT   ARE<br />
  DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE   LEGALLY<br />
  INVALID.<br />
  <br />
  10. Limitation of Liability.<br />
  <br />
  TO THE EXTENT NOT   PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ORACLE OR ITS LICENSORS BE<br />
  LIABLE FOR ANY   LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br />
  CONSEQUENTIAL,   INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE<br />
  THEORY OF   LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO   USE<br />
  SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ORACLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH   DAMAGES. In<br />
  no event will Oracle's liability to you, whether in contract,   tort (including<br />
  negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for   Software under this<br />
  Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if   the above stated<br />
  warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not   allow the exclusion<br />
  of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the   terms abov e may not be<br />
  applicable to you.<br />
  <br />
  11. Export   Regulations.<br />
  <br />
  All Software, documents, technical data, and any other   materials delivered under<br />
  this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control   laws and may be subject to<br />
  export or i mport regulations in other countries.   You agree to comply strictly<br />
  with these laws and regulations and acknowledge   that you have the responsibility<br />
  to obtain any licenses to export, re-export,   or import as may be required after<br />
  delivery to you .<br />
  <br />
  12. U.S.   Government Restricted Rights.<br />
  <br />
  If Software is being acquired by or on   behalf of the U.S. Government or by a<br />
  U.S. Government prime contractor or   subcontractor (at any tier), then the<br />
  Government's rights in Software and a   ccompanying documentation will be only as<br />
  set forth in this Agreement; this   is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through<br />
  227.7202-4 (for Department of   Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101<br />
  and 12.212 (for non-DOD   acquisitions).<br />
  <br />
  13. Governing Law.<br />
  <br />
  Any action related to this   Agreement will be governed by California law and<br />
  controlling U.S. federal   law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will<br />
  apply.<br />
  <br />
  14.   Severability.<br />
  <br />
  If any provisio n of this Agreement is held to be   unenforceable, this Agreement<br />
  will remain in effect with the provision   omitted, unless omission would<br />
  frustrate the intent of the parties, in which   case this Agreement will<br />
  immediately terminate.<br />
  <br />
  15.   Integration.<br />
  <br />
  This Agreement, including any terms contained in your   Entitlement, is the entire<br />
  agreement between you and Oracle relating to its   subject matter. It supersedes all<br />
  prior or contemporaneous oral or written   communications, prop osals,<br />
  representations and warranties and prevails over   any conflicting or additional<br />
  terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or   other communication between the<br />
  parties relating to its subject matter during   the term of this Agreement. No<br />
  modification of this Agreement will be   binding, unless in writing and signed by<br />
  an authorized representative of each   party.<br />

<p> &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<br />
  exercising permissions granted by this License.</p>
<p> &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br />
  including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br />
  source, and configuration files.</p>
<p> &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br />
  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br />
  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br />
  and conversions to other media types.</p>
<p> &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br />
  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br />
  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br />
  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>
<p> &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br />
  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br />
  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br />
  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br />
  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br />
  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br />
  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>
<p> &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including<br />
  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br />
  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br />
  submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br />

  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;<br />
  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br />

  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br />
  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br />
  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br />
  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br />
  designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br />
  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br />
  subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
<p> 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br />
  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br />
  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
<p> 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br />
  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br />
  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br />
  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br />
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br />
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br />
  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br />
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br />
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br />
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br />
  as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p> 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br />
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br />
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br />
  meet the following conditions:</p>
<p> (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br />
  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p> (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br />
  stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p> (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br />
  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br />
  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br />
  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br />
  the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p> (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its<br />
  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br />
  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br />
  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br />
  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br />
  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br />
  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br />
  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br />
  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br />
  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br />
  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br />
  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br />
  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br />
  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br />
  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br />
  as modifying the License.</p>
<p> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br />
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br />
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br />
  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br />
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br />
  the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<p> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br />
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br />
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br />
  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />
  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br />
  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br />
  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
<p> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br />
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br />
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br />
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
<p> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br />
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br />
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br />
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br />
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br />
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br />
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br />
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
<p> 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br />
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br />
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br />
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br />
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br />
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br />
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br />
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br />
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br />
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br />
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br />
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br />
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br />
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br />
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br />
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br />
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br />
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br />
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

  and/or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,<br />
  using or selling of Original Software, to make, have<br />
  made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or<br />
  otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or<br />
  portions thereof).</p>
<p>(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b)<br />
  are effective on the date Initial Developer first<br />
  distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software<br />
  available to a third party under the terms of this<br />
  License.</p>
<p>(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent<br />
  license is granted: (1) for code that You delete from<br />
  the Original Software, or (2) for infringements<br />
  caused by: (i) the modification of the Original<br />
  Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original<br />
  Software with other software or devices.</p>
<p>2.2. Contributor Grant.</p>
<p>Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and<br />
  subject to third party intellectual property claims, each<br />
  Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br />
  non-exclusive license:</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than<br />
  patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to<br />
  use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense<br />
  and distribute the Modifications created by such<br />
  Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an<br />
  unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as<br />
  Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,<br />
  using, or selling of Modifications made by that<br />
  Contributor either alone and/or in combination with<br />
  its Contributor Version (or portions of such<br />
  combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,<br />
  have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)<br />
  Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions<br />
  thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications<br />
  made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version<br />
  (or portions of such combination).</p>
<p>(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and<br />
  2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first<br />
  distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications<br />
  available to a third party.</p>
<p>(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent<br />
  license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor<br />
  has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for<br />
  infringements caused by: (i) third party<br />
  modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the<br />
  combination of Modifications made by that Contributor<br />
  with other software (except as part of the<br />
  Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under<br />
  Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the<br />
  absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.</p>
<p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make<br />
  available in Executable form must also be made available in<br />
  Source Code form and that Source Code form must be<br />
  distributed only under the terms of this License. You must<br />
  include a copy of this License with every copy of the<br />
  Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or<br />
  otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any<br />
  such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can<br />
  obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a<br />
  reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used<br />
  for software exchange.</p>
<p>3.2. Modifications.</p>
<p>The Modifications that You create or to which You<br />
  contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You<br />
  represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your<br />
  original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to<br />
  grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>3.3. Required Notices.</p>
<p>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications<br />
  that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.<br />
  You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or<br />
  trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or<br />
  any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving<br />
  attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.</p>
<p>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</p>
<p>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered<br />
  Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the<br />
  applicable version of this License or the recipients'<br />
  rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a<br />
  fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br />
  obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.<br />
  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br />
  behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You<br />
  must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,<br />
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by<br />
  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br />
  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred<br />
  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<br />
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered<br />
  Software under the terms of this License or under the terms<br />
  of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms<br />
  different from this License, provided that You are in<br />
  compliance with the terms of this License and that the<br />
  license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit<br />
  or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form<br />
  from the rights set forth in this License. If You<br />
  distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a<br />
  different license, You must make it absolutely clear that<br />
  any terms which differ from this License are offered by You<br />
  alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You<br />
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br />
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br />
  Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms<br />
  You offer.</p>
<p>3.6. Larger Works.</p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software<br />
  with other code not governed by the terms of this License<br />
  and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such<br />
  a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License<br />
  are fulfilled for the Covered Software.</p>
<p>4. Versions of the License.</p>
<p>4.1. New Versions.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and<br />
  may publish revised and/or new versions of this License<br />
  from time to time. Each version will be given a<br />
  distinguishing version number. Except as provided in<br />
  Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the<br />
  right to modify this License.</p>
<p>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise<br />
  make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br />
  version of the License under which You originally received<br />
  the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a<br />
  notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being<br />
  distributed or otherwise made available under any<br />
  subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and<br />
  make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br />
  version of the License under which You originally received<br />
  the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to<br />
  use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software<br />
  available under the terms of any subsequent version of the<br />
  License published by the license steward.</p>
<p>4.3. Modified Versions.</p>
<p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a<br />
  new license for Your Original Software, You may create and<br />
  use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename<br />
  the license and remove any references to the name of the<br />
  license steward (except to note that the license differs<br />
  from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that<br />
  the license contains terms which differ from this License.</p>
<p>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot;<br />
  BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,<br />
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED<br />
  SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR<br />
  PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND<br />
  PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY<br />
  COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE<br />
  INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF<br />
  ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF<br />
  WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br />
  ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS<br />
  DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>6. TERMINATION.</p>
<p>6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will<br />
  terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms<br />
  herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of<br />
  becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their<br />
  nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of<br />
  this License shall survive.</p>
<p>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding<br />
  declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or<br />
  a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against<br />
  whom You assert such claim is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)<br />
  alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the<br />
  Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor<br />
  or the Original Software where the Participant is the<br />
  Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any<br />
  patent, then any and all rights granted directly or<br />
  indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial<br />
  Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)<br />
  and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this<br />
  License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant<br />
  terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration<br />
  of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day<br />
  period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the<br />
  Participant Software against such Participant either<br />
  unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with<br />
  Participant.</p>
<p>6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2<br />
  above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted<br />
  by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination<br />
  (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)<br />
  shall survive termination.</p>
<p>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br />
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE<br />
  INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF<br />
  COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE<br />
  LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR<br />
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br />
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK<br />
  STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br />
  COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br />
  INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br />
  LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL<br />
  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT<br />
  APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO<br />
  NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR<br />
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT<br />
  APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p>The Covered Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is<br />
  defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial<br />
  computer software&quot; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤<br />
  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &quot;commercial computer software<br />
  documentation&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.<br />
  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1<br />
  through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users<br />
  acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.<br />
  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,<br />
  any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses<br />
  Government rights in computer software under this License.</p>
<p>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br />
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br />
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the<br />
  extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be<br />
  governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice<br />
  contained within the Original Software (except to the extent<br />
  applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such<br />
  jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation<br />
  relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of<br />
  the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a<br />
  notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing<br />
  party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court<br />
  costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The<br />
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the<br />
  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or<br />
  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall<br />
  be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br />
  You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the<br />
  United States export administration regulations (and the export<br />
  control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,<br />
  distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p>
<p>10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br />
  responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or<br />
  indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License<br />
  and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to<br />
  distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing<br />
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission<br />
of liability.</p>

<p>Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies</p>
<p>THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).</p>
<p>No Technical Support<br />
  Our technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone support, or updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement.</p>
<p>Restricted Rights<br />
  If you distribute a license to the United States government, the programs, including documentation, shall be considered commercial computer software and you will place a legend, in addition to applicable copyright notices, on the documentation, and on the media label, substantially similar to the following:</p>
<p>NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS</p>
<p>&quot;Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement. Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). Oracle America, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065.&quot;</p>
<p>End of Agreement<br />
  You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.</p>
<p>Relationship Between the Parties<br />
  The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.</p>
<p>Open Source<br />
  &quot;Open Source&quot; software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any &quot;modifications&quot; be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License (&quot;GPL&quot;) in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement<br />
  You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.<br />

<p><strong>Concurrent 1.3.4</strong></p>
<p>Maintained by Doug Lea, available without a license</p>
<p><strong>JUnit</strong></p>
<p>Common Public License - v 1.0</p>
<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>1. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>
<p> a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br />
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
<p> i) changes to the Program, and</p>
<p> ii) additions to the Program;</p>
<p> where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. </p>
<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>
<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>
<p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>
<p> a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p>
<p> b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. </p>
<p> c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</p>
<p> d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. </p>
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>
<p> a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>
<p> b) its license agreement:</p>
<p> i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; </p>
<p> ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; </p>
<p> iii)	states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>
<p> iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. </p>
<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
<p> a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and </p>
<p> b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. </p>
<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.</p>
<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>
<p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>
<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p>
<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</p>
<p>5. NO WARRANTY</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>
<p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>7. GENERAL</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

  Software become, or in Orac le's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of<br />
  a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation.<br />
  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm<br />
