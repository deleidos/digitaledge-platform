# HTTP-specific options.
http:

  # The port on which the HTTP server listens for service requests.
  # Because Java cannot drop privileges in a POSIX system, these
  # ports cannot be in the range 1-1024. A port value of 0 will
  # make the OS use an arbitrary unused port.
  port: 9080

  # The port on which the HTTP server listens for administrative
  # requests. Subject to the same limitations as "port". If this is
  # set to the same value as port, the admin routes will be mounted
  # under /admin.
  adminPort: 9081

  # The minimum number of threads to keep running to process
  # incoming HTTP requests.
  minThreads: 8

  # The maximum number of threads to keep running to process
  # incoming HTTP requests.
  maxThreads: 1024

  # The type of connector to use.
  #
  # Possible values are:
  #   * blocking: Good for low-latency services with short request
  #               durations. Corresponds to Jetty's
  #               BlockingChannelConnector.
  #   * nonblocking: Good for services which use Servlet 3.0
  #                  continuations or which maintain a large number
  #                  of open connections. Corresponds to Jetty's
  #                  SelectChannelConnector.
  #   * legacy: Simple, java.io.Socket-based connector. Corresponds to
  #             Jetty's SocketConnector.
  #   * legacy+ssl: Corresponds to Jetty's SslSocketConnector.
  #   * nonblocking+ssl: Corresponds to Jetty's
  #                      SslSelectChannelConnector.
