 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *

 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * The Canonical Format is what is produced when a parser parses the data as well as what is stored.
 * It is a JSON string that contains the data parsed into fields(and possibly enriched with more data fields).
 * Canonical Format is comprised of 3 parts.  The first two parts are mandatory and the third is optional: 
 * 
 * 1. RTWS Header - Inserted by all parsers, this adds information that all records will have.
 * 2. Common Model Fields: These are the normalized fields shared by all inputs, i.e., part of a common data model.
 * 3. Extrinsic Fields: These are fields that are unique to each input in their raw form.
 * 
 * Example Canonical Format:
 * {
 *    // Header included for all RTWS data
 *    "rtwsHeader" : {
 *         "id"         : "<uuid>"
 *         "accessLabel": "<label>",
 *         "inputName"  : "<name that represents this data input>",
 *         "modelName"  : "<name of the data model the data is parsed into>",
 *     },
 * 
 *     // Fields that are part of the common data model
 *     "eventid"             : "string",
 *     "eventType"           : "string",
 *     "objectType"          : "string",
 *     "objectIdName"        : "string",
 *     "objectIdValue"       : "string",
 *     "NumContent"  : number,
 *     "Content"     :
 *         [ { "contentName"   : "string",
 *             "mimeType"      : "string",
 *             "contentThumb"  : "string",
 *             "isURI"         : "string",
 *             "contentValue"  : "string"
 * 	  		 }
 *         ],
 * 
 *     // Extrinsic Data fields specific to each input, each listed separately
 *     "extrinsic_TaxiRoute" : {
 * 			"Route_Label"           : "string",
 *     },
 * 
 *     "extrinsic_GeoTaggedRouteImagery" : {
 *  	   "ImageWidth"          : "string",
 *         "ImageHeight"         : "string",
