        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="kanchor25"></a>Dimensional Data Modeling and Data Enrichment</h2>
        <p>To achieve rapid response to situational information, data cannot be opaque, coded, missing, or resident in an inaccessible data store. <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> correlates data from multiple data sources up-front during ingest processing, resulting in better query performance and data records which integrate facts and key descriptive values all in one record. To achieve these benefits, <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> uses a dimensional data modeling methodology with dimension table enrichments.</p>
        <p>Dimensional data modeling (DDM) is a database concept that is different than the third normal form entity-relationship (ER) modeling in traditional relational databases. ER modeling, created for transactional systems, was often complex, hard for users to understand, difficult for analytic tools to use, and required large joins that often resulted in very poor performance. DDM was created to support data querying performance and data understandability. DDM uses a standard structure that is readily understood by users and analytic tools, results in faster queries, provides descriptions for facts, and can be relatively easy to change. DDM excels with real time data processing and large scale analytics. </p>
        <p><a name="kanchor26"></a>In DDM, a <i>fact</i> is usually a measurement or numeric value such as a timestamp, a sales price, or an account ID; a <i>dimension</i> is a category of data that provides descriptive and contextual information for the main data feed/facts. For example, in a point of sale system, a sales record (the fact) is <i>enriched</i> with contextual customer data, store information, employee details, and product data (the dimensions). Dimensions improve the usability and enhance the meaning of raw data by adding additional information to the standard input model.</p>

        </div>
        <p><a name="kanchor27"></a>Traditional RDBMS implement DDM with foreign keys in the main table, referencing rows in the dimension tables. To integrate the data, database joins are performed during query time so the customer name (not the customer ID) is available in the retrieved record. But doing joins during a user’s search can significantly reduce performance. In a NoSQL environment, joins are not possible. So <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> pre-joins the dimension records to the raw data at ingest time. In other words, all the data from the customer record is merged with the sales record, eliminating the need for joining records or accessing other databases when querying records. All relevant data is pre-joined and stored in one record; the original record, which may have had just a few numbers, ids, or codes in it, is now enhanced with inline data. This process of correlating fact records with dimensional records is called <i>dimension table enrichment</i>, <i>keyed dimensional enrichment processing</i>, or simply <i>enrichment</i>. By pre-joining facts and dimensional data and storing all relevant data in one record, enrichment contributes to faster real-time queries and analytics.</p>

        </div>
        <p><a name="kanchor28"></a>Besides dimension table enrichment, <span class="VariablesProductName">DigitalEdge</span> provides other algorithmic enrichment techniques, known as <i>generalized enrichments</i>. Generalized enrichment extends DDM pre-joins to standard data available from other data sources. For example, one algorithm computes the nearest zip code given a set of latitude and longitude coordinates; another determines if a given IP address is local or private.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor29"></a>Data enrichment components can be private, applicable only to your system, or they can be shared with peers in a vertical market. For example, a set of data components could be developed for cyber security threats and shared among banks for a coordinated defense.</p>
