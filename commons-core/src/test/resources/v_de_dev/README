Spins up a Ubuntu 12.04 VM pre-configured to build/test DE components.

Requires VirtualBox 4.3.12 and Vagrant 1.7.2

Once you install VirtualBox and Vagrant, you can start this box by running 'vagrant up' from this directory.

Then after you ssh into the VM, the workspace is visible under /vagrant_data

You should be able to build and test which ever project you like e.g.) mvn clean test

Or run whatever webapp/app/container you need but it's env setup is on you.
