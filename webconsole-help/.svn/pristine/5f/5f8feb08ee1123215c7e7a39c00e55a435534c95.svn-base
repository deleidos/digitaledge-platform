        <p>The System Monitor visually depicts system activity and resource scaling. You can monitor processes as they auto-scale up and down and as resource utilization changes.</p>
        <p>The System Monitor is a dynamic console tool. The graphs change on-screen, reflecting the most current system status. You can monitor system health and potential problems in real time, including such items as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Ingest data flow rate</li>
            <li value="2">Record processing backlog</li>
            <li value="3">Alerting engine throughout</li>
            <li value="4">Resource consumption and auto-scaling</li>
            <li value="5">Data storage usage</li>
            <li value="6">User application activity</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3">System Monitor access</h3>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Access the <b>Management Console</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol data-mc-continue="true">
            <li value="2">Go to the <b>Systems</b> page. </li>
            <li value="3">Click on the <b>Monitor System </b> icon <img src="../resources/images/operations/0300000c.png" style="height: 25px;width: 26px;" class="icon_intext" /> on the row representing the <b>System</b> you wish to monitor. Or, click the <b>System Monitor </b><b>Tool</b>. <img src="../resources/images/operations/0300000d_26x28.png" style="width: 26;height: 28;" class="icon_intext" /> The <b>System Monitor</b> appears on a new browser page.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The System Monitor presents a dynamic picture of several key performance factors. There are two groups of graphs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Overview graphs</li>
            <li value="2">Detail graphs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor79"></a>Controls</h3>
        <p>Graph controls at the top and bottom of the screen change the data views:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Monitoring</b>: Click <b>Monitoring</b> to select the domain name of a different system to monitor</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Show Settings</b>: At the top right of the screen, click the <b>Show Settings</b> icon <img src="../resources/images/operations/0300000e.png" style="height: 26px;width: 26px;" class="icon_intext" /> to view settings that control the look and performance of all graphs: </li>
            <p class="Indent">
                <img src="../resources/images/operations/0300000f.png" class="regular" />
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Data Fetch</b><b> Interval</b>: Use this slider to set the number of seconds between refreshes and to define the intervals listed on the X axes</li>

            </ul>
            <li value="3"><b>Next Data Fetch</b>: At the bottom of the screen, the refresh counter displays the number of seconds left before the screen is refreshed. <img src="../resources/images/operations/03000010_288x18.png" style="width: 288;height: 18;" class="icon_intext" /></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor80"></a><a name="kanchor81"></a>Overview graphs</h3>
        <p>Click the <b>Overview</b> tab to view the basic system graphs simultaneously:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../resources/images/operations/03000011.png" class="large_graphic" />
        </p>
        <p>These graphs summarize metrics across all process groups: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Average Throughput</b>: The rate at which ingested records are fed into the system</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Queue Size</b>: The number of records that were fed into the system but which are not yet processed </li>
            <li value="3"><b>Number of Instances</b>: The number of instances that are automatically allocated and consumed for each process </li>
            <li value="4"><b>Storage Utilization</b>: The percentage of allocated space that is currently in use for each data sink which is an EBS (Amazon Elastic Block Storage) volume database </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="kanchor82"></a><a name="kanchor83"></a><b>Monitor data flow: Average Throughput graph</b>
        </h4>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../resources/images/operations/sm_average_thruput.png" class="regular" />
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Average Throughput</b> graph illustrates the rate at which records are ingested and processed in the system (records per second). Throughput time is clocked from the second a record enters the system to the time it is ready for querying (including transport from a data source into the JMS external queue, ingest processing, normalization, enrichment, indexing, and storage). Each line represents records from one process. The legend lists which color line represents each processor. </p>
        <p>Use the <b>Average Throughput</b> graph to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Check how data flow is affecting overall system performance</li>
            <li value="2">Make sure throughout is not sitting at zero, indicating an idle or problematic system</li>
            <li value="3">Check for expected throughput fluctuations based on historical knowledge of peaks and valleys in data feed activity</li>
            <li value="4">Determine how long (on average) it takes to process a record</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="kanchor84"></a><b>Monitor queue sizes: Queue Size</b><b> graph</b>
        </h4>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../resources/images/operations/sm_queue_size.png" class="regular" />
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Queue Size</b> graph illustrates how many messages have been fed into a specific processor but which have not yet been processed. This is your processing backlog, which obviously should be as low as possible. This chart monitors different processing queues (identified in the legend on the right), such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><strong>DLQ</strong>: The dead letter queue, where records that could not be parsed are saved</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Filter</b>: The alerting engine filters records for potential alerts and notifications</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Index</b>: Lucene indexed records in preparation for searching</li>
            <li value="4"><b>Parse</b>: The processing pipeline parses, normalizes, and enriches records </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use the scroll bar <img src="../resources/images/operations/sm_scrollbar.png" /> at the bottom of the graph to scroll through the timeline on the x axis. Note that the scroll bar only appears if the timeline doesn't fit into the width of the graph/browser window.</p>
        <p>Use the <b>Queue Size</b> graph to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Make sure the backlog queues are as low as possible</li>
            <li value="2">Determine if processing (<b>Average Throughput</b>) is keeping up with queue sizes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="kanchor85"></a>Monitor resource scaling: Number of Instances graph</h4>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../resources/images/operations/sm_num_instances_line.png" class="regular" />
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Number of Instances</b> graph depicts how many instances of each process type are allocated at any given time. The graph changes as processes scale up during peak activity and scale down as demand decreases. Each process is represented by a separate color line on the graph; the legend on the right is keyed to specific processors. The ingest.all processor is probably the most important process to monitor on this chart; the graph tells you if ingest auto-scaling is keeping up with throughput. </p>
        <p>Use the <b>Number of Instances</b> chart to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Monitor fluctuations in resource consumption</li>
            <li value="2">Decide if ingest processing is allocated sufficient resources</li>
            <li value="3">Determine if indexing (the Lucene processor) is keeping up with ingest</li>
            <li value="4">Verify that user activity (searching via webapps) is not affecting system performance</li>
            <li value="5">Determine if a processor is down</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note">Colors are assigned to specific services and synced across all charts.</p>
        <p>You can toggle this graph between a <b>Line Graph</b> and a <b>Bar Graph</b> view:</p>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../resources/images/operations/sm_num_instances_bar.png" class="regular" />
        </p>
        <p>In the <b>Bar Graph</b> view, you can set the <b>Noise Filter</b> percentage to specify how frequently the graph should be refreshed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">0% = Show all changes to allocated instances (i.e., the noise filter is off); this is the default setting</li>
            <li value="2">100% = Don’t show any changes to allocated instances (a static graph)</li>
            <li value="3">n% = Show increases or decreases in the number of allocated instances only when the delta reaches n% of the total number of instances; you will not see a change in the graph every time the number of instances increases or decreases</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="kanchor86"></a><b>Monitor storage usage: Storage Utilization graph</b>
        </h4>
        <p>The <b>Storage Utilization</b> chart depicts the percentage of allocated space that is currently in use for each data sink that is an EBS (Amazon Elastic Block Storage) volume database (e.g., Lucene, Hadoop). Each data sink is represented by a separate color line on the graph; the legend on the right is keyed to specific data sinks. This graph is populated when you implement a search app.</p>
        <p>Most data sinks are auto-scaling and dynamically expand when a usage threshold is reached. But some data sinks are not auto-scaling and must be monitored for space utilization; in that case, you must take action to allocate more storage when a critical threshold is reached. </p>
        <p>Use the <b>Storage Utilization</b> graph to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Determine if storage is reaching a critical point</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can toggle this graph between a <b>Line Graph</b> and a <b>Bar Graph</b> view.</p>
        <p>In the <b>Bar Graph</b> view, you can set the <b>Noise Filter</b> percentage to specify how frequently the graph should be refreshed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">0% = Show all changes to storage utilization (i.e., the noise filter is off); this is the default setting</li>
            <li value="2">100% = Don’t show any changes to storage usage (a static graph)</li>
            <li value="3">n% = Show changes in storage utilization only when the delta reaches n% of the total amount of currently utilized storage; you will not see a change in the graph <i>every</i> time storage use increases or decreases</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="kanchor87"></a>Detail graphs</h3>
        <p>Click the <b>Details</b> tab to access and drill down into the processing time graphs. These graphs help diagnose problems with slow throughput rates:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../resources/images/operations/sm_details_small_annotated.png" class="large_graphic" />
        </p>
        <p>These drill-down graphs break out metrics by a specific processor type; filtered by data model, node, and data source:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Ingest Processing Time</b>: The time it takes (in milliseconds) to ingest, parse, translate, and enrich a record per node for a specified data model</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Data Model Processing Time</b>: The time it takes (in milliseconds) to ingest, parse, translate, and enrich a record per data model for a specified node</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Processor Processing Time</b>: The time it takes to process a record in each stage of enrichment processing per node, data model, and data source feed</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note">If the Details graphs do not display any data, click the <b>Monitoring </b>control and click <b>Refresh </b>several times.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="kanchor88"></a><b>Monitor ingest per node: Ingest Processing Time</b>

        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../resources/images/operations/sm_details_ingest_processing_time.png" class="regular" />
        </p>
        <p>This graph depicts the time it takes to ingest a record, in milliseconds. Processing time includes ingest, parse, translate, and enrichment stages. Times are reported per node (one line per node, keyed to colors in the legend), for a selected data model. Click the <b>Displayed Data Model</b> graph option to select one data model to graph. Scroll through the graph with <b>Prev</b> and <b>Next</b> to compare ingest processing times across nodes.</p>
        <p>This graph also charts processing time by data sink.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="kanchor89"></a><b>Monitor ingest by data model: Data Model Processing Time</b>

            <img src="../resources/images/operations/sm_details_data_model_processing_time.png" class="regular" />
        </p>
        <p>This graph displays the time it takes to ingest a data model record, in milliseconds. Processing time includes ingest, parse, translate, and enrichment stages. Click the <b>Displayed Node</b> graph option to view statistics from one specific node. Each line represents records from one data model, keyed to colors in the legend.</p>
        <p>This graph also charts processing time by data sink.</p>
        <p>For example, use the <b>Ingest Processing Time </b>and<b> Data Model Processing Time</b> graphs to diagnose problems such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If one line on the<b> Ingest Processing Time</b> graph is running slow, drill down to that particular node/data model line in the <b>Data Model Processing Time</b> graph for comparison. Ingest may be slow if you have a large dimension table and a cache setting that is too small to efficiently process the data. You may have to configure a larger cache or restructure the dimension table to improve processing times.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="kanchor90"></a><b>Monitor processing stages: Processor Processing Time</b>
