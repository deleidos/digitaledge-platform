 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 * This is a really crappy implementation of a geo-spatial index. It provides methods to search for records based on
 * geo-spatial proximity. The implementation provided here divides the lat/lon space into bins, storing records into the
 * appropriate bin based on the coordinate position. Retrieval is optimized by narrowing the search to only those bins
 * that overlap the given search criteria.
 * 
 * In practice, this is only efficient for small data sets that are distributed over large geographic areas. Because
 * searching within each bin is performed linearly, data sets that a very large or very tight tend to overload some
 * bins. Thus, searches within heavily loaded bins yield near worst case performance.
