Fields with a large number of unique terms will <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-facets-terms-facet.html#_memory_considerations_2">use more memory</a> to calculate.</li><li><strong>Count</strong> / How many queries to generate. The resulting queries will use brightness variations on the original query's color for their own.</li><li><strong>Union</strong> / The relation the generated queries have to the original. For example, if your field was set to 'extension', your original query was "user:B.Awesome" and your union was AND.
