Notwithstanding the foregoing, decompiling the SDK is permitted to
the extent the laws of your jurisdiction give you the right to do
so to obtain information necessary to render the licensed portions
of the SDK interoperable with other software; provided, however,
that you must first request such information from Adobe and Adobe
may, in its sole discretion, either provide such information to you
or impose reasonable conditions, including a reasonable fee, on

Section 3.3.3, you may transfer copies of the SDK installed on one
of your computers to another one of your computers provided that
the resulting installation and use of the SDK is in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and does not cause you to exceed your
right to use the SDK under this Agreement.</p>

AIR&reg;&rdquo; is a trademark of Adobe that may not be used by
others except under a written license from Adobe. You may not
incorporate the Adobe AIR trademark, or any other Adobe trademark,
in whole or in part, in the title of your Developer Programs or in
your company name, domain name or the name of a service related to
Adobe AIR. You may indicate the interoperability of its Developer
Program with the Adobe AIR Runtime Software, if true, by stating,
for example, &ldquo;works with Adobe&reg; AIR&reg;&rdquo; or
&ldquo;for Adobe&reg; AIR&reg;.&rdquo; You may use the Adobe
AIR trademark to refer to your Developer Program as an
&ldquo;Adobe&reg; AIR&reg; application&rdquo; only as a
statement that your Developer Program interoperates with the Adobe
AIR Runtime Software.</p>
