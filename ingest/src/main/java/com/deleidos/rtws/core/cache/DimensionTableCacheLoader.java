 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

/**
 * Adaptor class to provide cache loading for an Ehcache. The Ehcache itself drive the loading; this class implements
 * the callback interfaces that ehcache uses to perform loading operations. In order to use this class, it needs to be
 * passed to a new Cache object at construction time (for the BootstrapCacheLoader callback to work), and that Cache
 * object needs to be wrapped in a new SelfPopulatingCache instance (for the CacheEntryFactory callback to work).
 * 
 * The initPolicy parameter controls how entries are added to the cache. When set to "LAZY", the cache is initially left
 * empty; calls to get on the Cache will trigger a createEntry() call that subsequently loads the missing entry. When
 * set to "EAGER" or "BACKGROUND", the initial call to load() will pull all the entries from the database and add them
 * to the cache. If the caches size is insufficient to accommodate all the records, which records get loaded is
 * arbitrary.
 * 
 * While both the EAGER and BACKGROUND policy will try to load entire cache at initialization time, the EAGER policy
 * indicated that this should be done in-line before any cache get requests can be invoked. The BACKGROUND policy cause
 * the initial load to be performed by a separate thread, allowing get requests to initiate before the cache is
 * populated. This will result in a high miss ratio at startup, but will allow usage to proceed without waiting for
 * initialization to complete.
 * 
 * The missPolicy parameter controls how the cache behaves when a requested record does not exist. When set to
 * "SUBSTITUTE", a second lookup will be done by asking the DAO for the "default" entry, which will be cached and
 * returned. When set to "INSERT", the natural key values provided in the lookup call will be passed to the DAO for
 * insertion into the database as a new record. The new record, including the assigned surrogate key, is cached and
 * returned. When set to "REJECT", no action is taken and null is returned.
