            ActiveMQ provides several options for how to store/dispatch messages. The
            values here are the default values; tuning may be needed.

            For more information, see:
            http://activemq.apache.org/message-cursors.html
            

            By default, ActiveMQ uses producerFlowControl to handle the condition where
            consumers are unable to keep up with producers. Flow control detects the
            disparity and blocks producers until the consumers catch up.

            It is disabled because the RTWS approach is intended to handle this condition
            instead by auto allocating additional consumers. Leaving flow control enabled
            would hide the condition we intend to use as our scale up trigger.

            The managementContext is used to configure how ActiveMQ is exposed in 
            JMX. By default, ActiveMQ uses the MBean server that is started by the
            JVM, and is only accessible to the local host. The createConnector has
            been changed to allow remote access.

            JMX uses two ports, one for JMX connections and one the RMI calls those
            connections will make on remotely managed beans. The JMX port has been
            left to its default, but the RMI port has been explicity set because the
            default behavour is use a random port (which means it can't be accessed
            through a firewall or through AWS security groups).

            The networkConnector is used to cluster JMS nodes, allowing queues to
            behave as distributed resources. Messages can be dynamically relocated
            to other nodes where consumers are under-loaded.

            There are two options when configuring broker connection, static and 
            discovery. Discovery allows brokers to auto-detect one another, however
            the discovery protocol uses multicast addressing, which is prohibited
            by AWS. A static connection example is provided below because it is the
            the only option that works (though it makes it impossible to dynamically
            add nodes to the cluster).
