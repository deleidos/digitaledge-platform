	 * The URLFileVariable class wraps file data to be sent to the server using a URLRequest.
	 *
	 * <p>To add an instance of URLFileVariable to a URLRequest you must first create a URLVariables
	 * instance and then set one or more of its properties with a URLFileVariable instance. This
	 * URLVariables instance should then be passed to a URLRequestBuilder which can construct
	 * the URLRequest with the correct encoding to transport the file(s) to the server.</p>
	 *
	 * @example
	 * <pre>
	 * // Construct variables (name-value pairs) to be sent to sever
	 * var variables:URLVariable = new URLVariables();
	 * variables.userImage = new URLFileVariable(jpegEncodedData, "user_image.jpg");
	 * variables.userPDF = new URLFileVariable(pdfEncodedData, "user_doc.pdf");
	 * variables.userName = "Mike";
	 * // Build the request which houses these variables
	 * var request:URLRequest = new URLRequestBuilder(variables).build();
	 * request.url = "some.web.address.php";
	 * // Create the loader and use it to send the request off to the server
	 * var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader();
	 * loader.addEventListener(SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR, onError);
	 * loader.addEventListener(HTTPStatusEvent.HTTP_STATUS, onError);
	 * loader.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, onError);
	 * loader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onServerResponse);
	 * loader.load(request);
	 * function onServerResponse(event:Event):void
	 * {
	 * trace("Variables uploaded successfully");
	 * }
	 * function onError(event:Event):void
	 * {
	 * trace("An error occured while trying to upload data to the server: \n" + event);
	 * }
	 * </pre>
