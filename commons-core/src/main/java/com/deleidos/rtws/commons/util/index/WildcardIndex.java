 * Index used to associate objects with wildcard expressions. Searching this index returns
 * entries who's indexed value is a wildcard match against a given literal value. For example,
 * indexing the value "user@*.com", allows you to later search for literal values such as
 * "user@gmail.com" and find whatever entry was associated with the pattern "user@*.com".
 * 
 * Note that searching a wildcard index is not the same wildcard searching an index. That is
 * to say that you cannot search for "user@*.com" and find entries like "user@gmail.com" and
 * "user@hotmail.com". The search string must be fixed literal.
 * 
 * This index offers two modes of operation, precise (default) and imprecise. Precise mode
 * provides strict matching against searched values, but has a higher performance cost.
 * Imprecise mode performs only a partial match against searched values, which can return
 * "spurious" hits. However, if you were going to "verify" the hit post search anyway, then
 * using imprecise mode improves performance.

	 * Inner class representing a node in a polyary tree.
	 * 
	 * The indexes built here are a tree such that each element in the tree is a character
	 * from either a prefix or suffix of an indexed string. To find an entry for a given value,
	 * one starts at the root and, with each successive character in the value, bifurcates down
	 * the next path in the tree (each child path represent a different next character in the
	 * sequence).
	 * 
	 * Because the intent is to index "wildcard" expressions, one cannot index the "wild"
	 * portions of a string. Instead, a partial index is generated using only the prefix
	 * up to the leading wildcard, and the suffix back to the last trailing wildcard. (Both
	 * the prefix and suffix are index to insure that values that may start immediately with
	 * a wildcard do not defeat the index, limiting "worst case" values to only those that
	 * both start and end with a wildcard; which are hopefully few).
	 * 
	 * To illustrate... Indexing the expression "john*@mail.*.com" yields the following tree.
	 * Notice that the ".com" suffix is indexed backwards (to simplify searching), and the
	 * "@mail." portion is lift out altogether. The star that terminates the prefix is
	 * retained as part of the index as a flag to indicate that the following characters are
	 * part of the suffix rather than a continuation of the prefix. And the last star is
	 * retained to indicate the end of a suffix (so that partial matches are not returned).  
	 * <pre><code>
	 * ->j->o->h->n->*->m->o->c->.->*
	 * </code></pre>
	 * 
	 * If we add another value "josh*@mail.*.com", the tree will then look as follows.
	 * <pre><code>
	 *        /->h->n->*->m->o->c->.->*
	 * ->j->o-
	 *        \->s->h->*->m->o->c->.->*
	 * </code></pre>
	 *
	 * And if we add a value with a shared suffix, such as "john*@gmail.com", we get the following.
	 * <pre><code>
	 *                               /->l->i->a->m->g->@->*
