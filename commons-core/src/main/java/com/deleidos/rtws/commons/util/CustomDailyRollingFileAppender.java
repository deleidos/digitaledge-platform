/**
 DailyRollingFileAppender extends {@link FileAppender} so that the
 underlying file is rolled over at a user chosen frequency.

 DailyRollingFileAppender has been observed to exhibit 
 synchronization issues and data loss.  The log4j extras
 companion includes alternatives which should be considered
 for new deployments and which are discussed in the documentation
 for org.apache.log4j.rolling.RollingFileAppender.

 <p>The rolling schedule is specified by the <b>DatePattern</b>
 option. This pattern should follow the {@link SimpleDateFormat}
 conventions. In particular, you <em>must</em> escape literal text
 within a pair of single quotes. A formatted version of the date
 pattern is used as the suffix for the rolled file name.

 <p>For example, if the <b>File</b> option is set to
 <code>/foo/bar.log</code> and the <b>DatePattern</b> set to
 <code>'.'yyyy-MM-dd</code>, on 2001-02-16 at midnight, the logging
 file <code>/foo/bar.log</code> will be copied to
 <code>/foo/bar.log.2001-02-16</code> and logging for 2001-02-17
 will continue in <code>/foo/bar.log</code> until it rolls over
 the next day.

 <p>Is is possible to specify monthly, weekly, half-daily, daily,
 hourly, or minutely rollover schedules.

 <p><table border="1" cellpadding="2">
 <tr>
 <th>DatePattern</th>
 <th>Rollover schedule</th>
 <th>Example</th>

 <tr>
 <td><code>'.'yyyy-MM</code>
 <td>Rollover at the beginning of each month</td>

 <td>At midnight of May 31st, 2002 <code>/foo/bar.log</code> will be
 copied to <code>/foo/bar.log.2002-05</code>. Logging for the month
 of June will be output to <code>/foo/bar.log</code> until it is
 also rolled over the next month.

 <tr>
 <td><code>'.'yyyy-ww</code>

 <td>Rollover at the first day of each week. The first day of the
 week depends on the locale.</td>

 <td>Assuming the first day of the week is Sunday, on Saturday
 midnight, June 9th 2002, the file <i>/foo/bar.log</i> will be
 copied to <i>/foo/bar.log.2002-23</i>.  Logging for the 24th week
 of 2002 will be output to <code>/foo/bar.log</code> until it is
 rolled over the next week.

 <tr>
 <td><code>'.'yyyy-MM-dd</code>

 <td>Rollover at midnight each day.</td>

 <td>At midnight, on March 8th, 2002, <code>/foo/bar.log</code> will
 be copied to <code>/foo/bar.log.2002-03-08</code>. Logging for the
 9th day of March will be output to <code>/foo/bar.log</code> until
 it is rolled over the next day.

 <tr>
 <td><code>'.'yyyy-MM-dd-a</code>

 <td>Rollover at midnight and midday of each day.</td>

 <td>At noon, on March 9th, 2002, <code>/foo/bar.log</code> will be
 copied to <code>/foo/bar.log.2002-03-09-AM</code>. Logging for the
 afternoon of the 9th will be output to <code>/foo/bar.log</code>
 until it is rolled over at midnight.

 <tr>
 <td><code>'.'yyyy-MM-dd-HH</code>

 <td>Rollover at the top of every hour.</td>

 <td>At approximately 11:00.000 o'clock on March 9th, 2002,
 <code>/foo/bar.log</code> will be copied to
 <code>/foo/bar.log.2002-03-09-10</code>. Logging for the 11th hour
 of the 9th of March will be output to <code>/foo/bar.log</code>
 until it is rolled over at the beginning of the next hour.


 <tr>
 <td><code>'.'yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm</code>

 <td>Rollover at the beginning of every minute.</td>

 <td>At approximately 11:23,000, on March 9th, 2001,
 <code>/foo/bar.log</code> will be copied to
 <code>/foo/bar.log.2001-03-09-10-22</code>. Logging for the minute
 of 11:23 (9th of March) will be output to
 <code>/foo/bar.log</code> until it is rolled over the next minute.

 <p>Do not use the colon ":" character in anywhere in the
 <b>DatePattern</b> option. The text before the colon is interpeted
 as the protocol specificaion of a URL which is probably not what
 you want.

<b>Important Note:</b>
This is modified version of <code>DailyRollingFileAppender</code>. I have just added <code>maxBackupIndex</code>. So, if your number of log files increased more than <code>maxBackupIndex</code> it will delete the older log files.
The modified code only tested on Windows Operating System. If it have any issue on any other platform please modified it accordingly.
